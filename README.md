# Welcome to Open Fire

Welcome to Open Fire, the open source tabletop wargame system designed to let you play and create wargames for any setting, scale, or size of game. To get started you can download the core rules which explain how the game works and provides a simple starter module to get started. Once you understand the basics of the game you can explore the community created modules which expand the game into many different types of wargame, or create your own and share it with others.

As this game is still actively in development, it may still be feature incomplete and have inconsistencies and errors. You could help to push this project forward. If you are interested see this discussion post:
