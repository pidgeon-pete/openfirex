# Open Fire

Version 0.0.1

## Introduction

Open Fire is an open source tabletop war game system that lets you enact battles from any setting and at any scale. This rule book provides the core rules and mechanics used when playing a game but needs to be paired with a game module to provide the setting, additional or modified rules, and army lists that let you know what kind of miniatures you can use.

The core rules are open source, licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International licence. This means anyone can use and modify these rules, even for commercial purposes, so long as clear attribution is given to the original version.

# Section 1 - Core Rules

## Getting Started

### What You Will Need

In order to play a game of Open Fire you are going to need a few things:

- The core rules found in this book.
- A game module for the setting you want to play.
- The miniatures to represent your forces on the tabletop.
- A space to represent your battlefield, a few square feet is enough for a small game.
- Some terrain to fill your battlefield, even a few simple objects are enough to get started.
- Some different coloured 12 sided dice.
- A ruler marked in inches.

The amount of time needed to play a game can vary depending on the size of game you choose to play: a small to medium game may take around an hour, with larger games taking 2 or more.

### Game Modules

Game modules are an important concept in Open Fire, representing the other half of the game. The core rules tell you how to play, the game module provides the army lists, missions, background information, unique rules for that setting and more.

We encourage players to invent their own game modules, or to contribute to other community created ones, to cover any setting or theme that you might want to play.

### Resolving Issues

With a game as complex as Open Fire there may be times when you are not sure on the correct way to resolve a situation. It is usually best to keep playing and agree to a simple resolution (or roll-off to see who gets to decide) to the situation and search for the correct answer after the game.

## Models and Units

### Models

Whatever kind of game you are playing you will need something to represent your forces on the tabletop. Regardless of whether you use scale miniatures, paper miniatures, tokens or some other representation, as far as the rules are concerned these are all called models.

Most of the time each model represents one warrior, monster, vehicle or something similar but they may also represent a number of warriors - especially at smaller scales. Whatever is being represented, what matters is that a “model” is something that is mounted on a base, or has an easily identifiable footprint to count as its base.

Many games will often group models together to represent squads or some other formation, and this is represented in the game as a unit. It is important to remember that every model is part of exactly one unit, even if that unit only consists of one model.

### Profiles

To define how your models work on the tabletop each unit will have a profile, a set of data that specifies each model’s attributes, the weapons they have, special rules that apply to them, and any other important information. You will find the profiles for different units in game modules, or army lists that go with that game module.

### Attributes

Each model in the game has a set of attributes which are detailed in the unit profile for that model.

These attributes are:

- [MOV] Movement Rate: The speed at which the model can move in inches.
- [SKL] Battle Skill: The skill this model has with its weapons.
- [DEF} Defence: The model's armour and natural toughness.
- [CMD] Command Rating: The models ability to weather the stresses of battle.
- [HP] Hit Points: The amount of damage a model can take.

A unit profile will also include some information that applies to every model in the unit:

- Special Rules: These modify how the models operate in the game.
- Unit Options: Many units will allow you to customise the unit, choosing different weapons or equipment options or choosing how many models are in the unit. You will typically find details on how many models a unit has, their equipment, and options you can take in a list under the attributes.

### Weapons

In order to fight,  your models require weapons and these will be listed in their unit profiles. Each weapon also has its own set of attributes, which describe how it functions in the game.

- [RNG] Range: The distance, in inches, at which the weapon can be used. A single value indicates the maximum range of a weapon, whereas a double value (such as 6-24) indicates both a minimum and maximum distance.
- {ATT] Attacks: Represents the volume and intensity of an attack from this weapon.
- [DMG] Damage: How destructive a hit from this weapon is.
- [PRC] Piercing: The weapons ability to ignore or punch through armour.
- Special Rules: Special rules modify how the weapon works.

### Leaders and Formation

Every unit must have a leader model, this model does not have to be different to other models in the unit but is usually a squad leader, officer or similar. What matters is that the leader can be easily identified during play.

The models in a unit move and fight together, staying within 4 inches of the leader model. This is known as being “in formation”. When there is intervening terrain or different height levels around the leader then models must be placed somewhere the unit leader could move to with a 4 inch move. Thus models may not be placed on the other side of walls, or on top of unclimbable terrain, etc.

### Alignment

Some rules will specify that they only affect models or units of a certain alignment. Friendly refers to any other unit or model belonging to the same player while Enemy refers to any unit or model belonging to an opposing player. Allied is only used where multiple players play on the same side with different forces. Neutral refers to any unit that is not hostile to any player.

### Unit and Model Status

During a game you will need to track a few different status and effects. These are:

- Hit Points: When a model takes damage, but is not destroyed or killed, you should place a dice or marker next to it showing how many hit points it has left, typically a red dice.
- Suppression Level: During a game a unit can become suppressed and less effective. A unit can have 1 or 2 suppression tokens or you can mark this with a dice, typically a black dice.
- Activation Markers: During a game, each time a unit activates a marker should be placed next to it, this is to help remember which units have been activated and which have not.

### Armies and Points

When playing a game you and your opponent will be using miniatures to fight a battle. Your miniatures, as units in the game, comprise your “army” (or gang, warband, etc).

You can choose the models to play your game simply by agreeing with your opponent on what feels like an interesting game. However some modules will include points and restrictions allowing you to create relatively balanced forces for a more competitive game.

## Dice and Measuring

### 12 Sided Dice

Open Fire uses 12 sided dice to determine the outcome of many actions, often abbreviated as D12. Dice like this are also useful to have in a few different colours to show a model's hit points, suppression level and so on.

### Attribute Tests and Roll-offs

A common mechanic is a type of dice roll called an Attribute Test. Simply roll a dice and compare it to the model’s attribute. If it equals or succeeds the attribute value it is a success, if it is less than the attribute it is a failure. In addition, any roll of a 12 is considered a Critical Success and is always considered a success.

The other type of dice roll that you typically use is called a roll-off. Both players roll a number of dice and the player that rolls the highest combined value wins the roll-off, with any ties being re-rolled.

### Modifiers and Re-rolls

Modifiers are an important part of the game and apply to many of the rolls you make, effectively increasing or decreasing the value rolled. When multiple modifiers apply these are cumulative and the final modifier should be worked out before rolling the dice. A roll can never be modified above 12 or below 1.

You may sometimes be permitted to re-roll a dice, if you do so you must take the second result even if it is worse. You may never re-roll a dice more than once.

### Measuring Distances

To measure a distance from a model you always measure from the closest point on the base to the closest point on an object or point you are measuring to. You may measure anything at any time so long as doing so does not interfere with something your opponent is doing or unnecessarily slow down the game.

### Within vs Wholly Within

Sometimes a rule will state that something must be “within” or “wholly within” a range. A model or object is “within” a range if any part of its base is closer or equal to the specified distance. A model is “wholly within” when every part of its base is closer or equal to the specified distance.

### Assault Range

All models have an area around them within which they are an increased threat, able to attack with deadly melee or close quarters weapons. This area extends 1 inch from the edge of a model's base and is called its Assault Range.

## Moving and Attacking

### Actions

During a game your units will be able to perform a range of actions, some of which share some common rules or require some extra explanation, the details of which are shown below.

### Moving Units

In the game there are three distinct movement actions: Advance, Rush, and Assault. Though they each have their own purposes they all follow these same rules for how to move your units.
When moving a unit, it is just the leader model that is initially moved, with the remaining members of the unit then being placed in formation around it.

The leader model may move up to its Movement Rate in inches. When moving a model it is always moved in a straight line, but can stop and change direction at any point - so long as the total distance moved does not exceed the model's Movement Rate.

A model may not voluntarily move off the board at any point during a move action and other members of a unit may not be placed off the board after the leader moves.
A model may not move over the base of any other models except for models in the same unit.

## Terrain

### Understanding Terrain

A model cannot move through terrain objects and instead must move around them or over them following the rules for different kinds of terrain.

### Keywords

To understand how your terrain works Open Fire uses a simple system of keywords. A keyword may apply to a whole piece of terrain or to specific parts of your terrain. Make sure all players know which keywords apply to the terrain before playing.

### Footprint

Some types of terrain affect an area, such as rough terrain. Any terrain that affects an area should have a clearly defined boundary where the keywords will be in effect.

### Height Levels

Terrain that is climbable, has clear or other areas that models can be placed in, must have a height value. A single height level is usually around 1-2 inches in height, with the lowest level being level 0.
Models moving over terrain that is the same height level, even if there are small changes in height on the model, do not count the vertical distance travelled.

**Clear**
This keyword applies to any area on your terrain on which models can be placed and move as normal, this is usually for walkways, the tops of hills and so on and merely indicates that models do not need to move around it. It can often be omitted where it is obvious which parts of your terrain are clear.

**Impassable**
Models cannot climb over or move through this piece of terrain (unless permitted by a special rule).

**Obscuring**
The terrain object obscures any line of sight through it (see the section on making attacks). If the terrain is not impassable then models wholly within the footprint also count as Obscured for determining line of sight.

**Light Cover**
The terrain provides some cover but does not completely obscure the models in or behind it. Models within the footprint of Light Cover, or partly obscured by light cover during an attack, gain +1 to their Defence Tests.

**Heavy Cover**
Heavy Cover follows the same rules for Light Cover except that models gain +3 to their Defence Test.

**Climbable**
This applies to vertical terrain that has a raised area which is clear or that can be climbed over to the other side. A model may ascend climbable terrain at the cost of 1 inch of its movement per height level increase and may descend climbable terrain at the cost of 1 inch of its movement per 2 height levels descended.

A model may only climb terrain if it has enough movement remaining to be placed on Clear terrain at the end of their movement, unless making a second movement action in which case they may use that movement to continue climbing.

**Dangerous**
If the unit leader moves through an area of dangerous terrain then you must roll a dice for each model in the unit, each Critical Success counts as a successful attack against the unit with a Damage Attribute of 1 and Piercing Attribute of 0 (see the section on attacks).

**Slow**
The slow keyword should only be applied to an area that models can move through. Any model making a move action that includes any part of the move within slow terrain reduces their Movement Rate by 2 for this action.

**Rough**
Rough terrain may be moved through like Clear terrain but a model may not finish its movement on it and no other models may be placed on it.

## Making Attacks

### Line of Sight

When a unit makes an attack it must have a clear line of sight to do so. Put simply it must be able to see its target. Before making any attack rolls you must determine if the target unit is either Clear, Obscured, or Blocked.

To determine line of sight, similar to moving your units, it is the leader model that is used. You can determine if your leader can see another model by looking from the model's perspective.

If you can see all of an enemy model, ignoring terrain that does not have the obscuring keyword then you have a clear line of sight.

If any part of the model is covered by terrain with the obscuring keyword then you have an obscured line of sight.

If you cannot see any part of the model due to intervening terrain with the obscuring keyword then you have a blocked line of sight.

In addition, if you can see a model but there is a model from another friendly or enemy unit (not the attacking unit or the target unit) then you have a blocked line of sight.

If you have a blocked line of sight to a unit you may not make an attack against it and must choose another target.

### Seeing Through Terrain

If your terrain does not have the obscuring keyword but does block the line of sight it does not affect the line of sight to that unit, instead it will have the effect as stated by its keywords.

### Seeing A Model

When looking to see if you can or cannot see an enemy model, you should not count any small parts that stick out from the main model, such as sword blades, tips of gun barrels, antennae on vehicles etc.

When targeting a unit with multiple models you determine the line of sight to each model in the enemy unit and whichever of the three types is in majority will apply to the whole unit. If there is no majority (i.e. there are equal amounts of two or all of the types then that unit counts as being obscured.

### Evading an Attack

When a unit is targeted for an attack by a unit that is more than 6 inches away they can try to evade the attack. When your unit is targeted, before the attacking player rolls their Battle Skill test you must declare that you will try to evade the attack.

If you choose to evade an attack then you will gain a +2 modifier to any Defence Test you have to make against this attack. Once you have made your Defence Tests for your unit it then takes a suppression token, up to a maximum of 2.

If your unit already has 2 suppression tokens it may not choose to evade another attack.

# Section 2 - Game Structure

## Overview of a Game

To make it easier to play, the game is broken down into stages, which are further broken down into various steps. A game of Open Fire will go as follows:

### Set Up Stage

The Set Up Stage is where players set up their battlefield and armies ready to play.

- Choose a Mission.
- Set Up Terrain.
- Determine Deployment Areas.
- Set Up Objectives.
- Deploy Armies.
- Deploy Scouts.

### Battle Stage

The Battle Stage consists of multiple rounds with the following structure:

- Collect Activation Markers.
- Determine Initiative Order.
- Alternate Activating Units.

### Aftermath Stage

The Aftermath Stage is where the winner is determined, along with the degrees of success or failure for various objectives. Throughout the game you will have a chance to earn points for completing objectives, the highest score at the end of the game is the winner.

## Setup Stage

### Choose Module and Game Size

Before playing a game, players decide which module they will use, and what size of game they wish to play.

### Choose Mission

Players agree, or randomly determine, which mission they wish to play. A set of 3 basic missions is provided in this book and many more are available in game modules and as expansions.

A mission provides several things:

- Any essential terrain that needs to be included on your table.
- The size and position of your deployment areas.
- Objectives for the mission and how they are scored.
- The number of turns the game will last for.

### Set Up Terrain

Setting up the terrain for your game may be determined by the mission you are playing, but if you are setting up your terrain for yourself you should try to ensure that it provides a few essential things:

Terrain should block some lines of sight across the battlefield so that models may have a chance to advance unseen.

You need enough space for models to move freely, especially if large models are being used. They do not need to be able to go everywhere but should not be restricted from moving at all.

Some smaller scatter terrain to provide some occasional cover for models in the open.

If one player sets up all the terrain, then the other player should be provided an opportunity to modify the setup before players set up objectives or determine deployment areas.

### Set Up Objectives

Once you have set up your terrain you can set up your objectives. Most objectives will be simple markers that either represent certain goals or positions on the battlefield and suitable markers will be required. An objective marker should be around 1-2 inches in diameter. Your mission will instruct you how these should be set up.

### Determine Deployment Areas

Deployment areas are locations on the battlefield that your forces will be set up in before the game starts. Players should roll off, with the winner choosing which deployment area they want to use.

### Deploy Armies

Players now take it in turn to deploy their armies. Unless otherwise specified players set up all of their forces wholly within their deployment in order of who won the roll off for deployment areas.

### Deploy Scouts

Models that have the Scout special rule may be held back from being deployed until all players have finished deploying their armies. Instead, they may be deployed in the deploy scouts step. In the same order as armies were deployed, players alternate placing one scout unit anywhere on the battlefield that is more than 12 inches away from any enemy unit.

## Battle Stage

### Rounds

The Battle Stage is where the main action of a game takes place. It is broken down into multiple rounds. The game module or mission may specify how many rounds a game has but otherwise it should be assumed that a game has 5 rounds, after which play moves on to the Aftermath Stage.

### Collect Activation Markers

After the first round is complete, each unit will have acquired an Activation Marker to show that it has been activated. Once a new round begins each player should collect all of their markers and set them aside, as each unit will be able to activate again.

### Determine Initiative Order

At the start of each round the players must determine the initiative order. Each player rolls a number of dice equal to the number of players and adds them together for their total, re-rolling any ties. The initiative order for that round goes from the highest roll to the lowest.

### Alternate Activations

In initiative order, players take it in turns to select a unit that has not yet been activated this turn. That unit may then take 2 actions from the action list.

## Actions

When a unit is activated it may perform up to 2 actions from the following action list. With the exception of the Recover action, a unit may not perform any single action more than once.

Once a unit has finished performing its actions, an activation marker should be placed next to it to indicate that it has been activated.

### Recover

A unit that has accrued suppression tokens becomes less effective in battle and may stop fighting altogether. Taking a Recover action gives the unit a chance to regain their cool and keep fighting.

A unit taking a Recover action makes a Command Test, rolling a dice and comparing the result to their Command Attribute. The following modifiers apply to the roll:

- +2 if the unit is in the Assault Range of an enemy unit.
- +1 if there are no enemy units within 6 inches.
- +1 if there are no enemy units within 12 inches.
- +2 if there is at least one friendly unit within 6 inches.

If the unit fails the Command Test they lose one suppression token (but have still lost one of their actions this turn).

If the unit passes the Command Test they lose one suppression token and may take one additional action this turn.

If the unit passes the Command Test with a Critical Success it loses all its suppression tokens and may take one additional action this turn.

### Advance

A unit may not take this action if it has 2 suppression tokens on it.

An Advance action allows the unit to move up to its Movement Rate following the rules for moving units.

A unit taking this action cannot enter the assault range of an enemy unit.

A unit that has 1 suppression token on it has its Movement Rate reduced by 2 for this action.

If this unit is already within the Assault Range of an enemy unit it may take this action freely if it does not leave that unit's Assault Range.

If this unit wishes to move out of the Assault Range of an enemy unit that unit may make a free Attack action against this unit. The Attack action is worked out before the unit is moved.

### Rush

A unit may not take this action if it has any suppression tokens on it.

A unit may not take this action if it is within the assault range of any enemy units.

The unit moves following the normal rules for moving a unit but has its Movement Rate reduced by 2 for this action.

A unit taking this action cannot enter the assault range of an enemy unit.

### Assault

A unit may not take this action if it has any suppression tokens on it.

A unit taking an assault action is closing with an enemy unit, to engage it with close quarters weapons.

A unit making an assault action may move up to its Movement Rate plus 3, but must move into the engagement range of an enemy unit. If this is not possible the player must choose a different action to perform.

A unit taking this action may not move out of the assault range of an enemy unit if it is already within the assault range of that enemy unit at the start of the action.

### Attack

A unit may not take this action if it has 2 suppression tokens on it.

A unit that wishes to attack an enemy unit must follow the attack procedure outlined below:

**Choose Target and Weapons**
The first step in making an attack is choosing which unit or units you wish to attack. If your unit is in assault range with one or more enemy units you may only choose to attack those units and may only use weapons with a maximum range of 1.

Determine which weapon each model will make an attack with and which units will be attacked, you may choose to target different units with each model in a unit. A model may only use one weapon during an attack, if it is equipped with more than one you may choose which to use.

**Determine Range and Line of Sight**
All weapons have a range attribute that tells you the maximum (and sometimes minimum) range at which it can be used. To measure the range you always measure from the unit leader to any model in the unit that you are targeting. If you find a weapon is not in range you may change which weapons are targeting which units.

The next step is to determine the Line of Sight to an enemy unit. Follow the rules in section 1 to determine if you have a clear, obstructed, or blocked line of sight to each target unit.

**Target Reaction**
Once you have finished declaring which units are being targeted, and checked if you have a valid line of sight to make the attack, the controlling player of the units being targeted can choose to try to evade the attack as outlined in section 1.

**Battle Skill Test**
You now need to make a roll for each weapon to see if it hits its target. You will roll a number of Battle Skill tests for each model equal to the Attacks attribute of the weapon the model is using - trying to equal or beat the models Battle Skill attribute. Each successful battle skill roll is called a hit.

The following modifiers apply to your battle skill test:

- -3 if you have a suppression token on this unit.
- -3 if you have an obstructed line of sight.

**Make Defence Rolls**
For each successful hit against your unit you must take a Defence test to avoid taking damage.

Reduce your Defence attribute for each successful hit by the attacking weapon's Piercing attribute.

There are also other modifiers which apply to your defence test:

- +1 for light cover (see the section on terrain).
- +3 for heavy cover.
- +2 if you chose to evade the attack (see section 1)

**Calculate Wounds and Remove Casualties**
For each failed Defence test your unit will take an amount of damage equal to the attacking weapon's Damage attribute. Calculate the total amount of damage during an attack before applying them to your unit.

Choose any model in your unit, except the leader unless it is the only model remaining, and reduce its Hit Points by the amount of damage your unit sustained. If it is reduced to 0 Hit Points remove it from the game as a casualty and select another model to receive the remaining damage. Continue doing this until you have assigned all the damage you have taken to models or until every model in the unit has been removed.

If a model takes damage, but is not reduced to 0, place a dice next to the model showing how many hit points it has remaining. If your unit takes damage and has a model that has already taken damage in a previous attack, you must assign any new damage to that model first.

**Interact**
Interacting is a special action that allows units to engage with interactive elements on the battlefield, this may be something as simple as securing an objective or activating a terminal. Any objects which have interaction rules will specify how they work, some will simply require the unit is within a certain range, others may require an attribute test. Either way the unit must perform the Interact action.

**Unique Actions**
Some game modules, expansions, or units may provide additional actions unique to them, unless otherwise specified the same rules apply to those actions as with these standard actions.

## Aftermath Stage

Once the final round of the Battle Stage is complete players then determine the outcome of the battle.

# Section 3 - Advanced Rules

## Vehicles

### Vehicle Movement

Models with the Vehicle special rule use the following rules for movement. In addition, models with the Vehicle special rule may not take the Dash action.

### Transports

Models with the Transport (X) special rule can use the following rules that allow them to carry other models across the battlefield.

### Aircraft

## Special Rules

### Bracket Values

Some special rules have a value indicated in their title, such as Heavy Armour (X), where X can be different values for each unit. When a unit has this rule it will be given with a number in place of the X, substitute this value in the text of the special rule.

### Unit Special Rules

**Fearless**
Units with the Fearless rule may re-roll any Command Test.

**Flying**
Models with the Flying rule are not affected by terrain when they move.

**Heavy Armour (X)**
Models with the Heavy Armour (X) rule reduce the Damage and Piercing value of attacks made against it by X. The Damage value cannot be reduced below 1 and the Piercing value cannot be reduced below 0.

**Scout**
Units with the Scout rule may be set up in the Deploy Scouts step of the Setup Stage following the rules for setting up scouts.

**Stealth (X)**
When targeting a unit with the Stealth rule you suffer a -X modifier to your Battle Skill Test.
Transport (X)

Models with the Transport rule may transport up to X models following the advanced rules for Transports.

**Vehicle**
Models with the Vehicle rule follow the advanced rules for Vehicles.

### Weapon Special Rules

**Impact**
A unit may make a free attack action with this weapon after completing an Assault action. This attack may only target a unit within assault range.

**Longshot**
This weapon may make an attack at up to twice its maximum range but it's Attacks attribute is reduced to 1 and the Battle Skill test suffers a -1 modifier.
